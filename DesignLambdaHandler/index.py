The design of a greenfield system for a mature domain occurs when you are designing an architecture for a system that is built from “scratch” and when this type of system is well known and understood—that is, when there is an established infrastructure of tools and technologies, and an associated knowledge base. Examples of mature domains include the following:

Image Traditional desktop applications

Image Interactive applications that run on a mobile device

Image Enterprise applications accessed from a web browser, which store information in a relational database, and which provide support for partially or fully automating business processes

Since these types of applications are relatively common, some general architectural concerns associated with their design are well known, well supported, and well documented. If you are designing a new system that falls into this category, we recommend the following roadmap

Iteration 1: Establishing an Initial Overall System Structure

    Goal: The primary goal of the first iteration is to establish an initial overall system structure. This involves defining the basic architecture that will serve as the foundation for the system.
    Design Concepts:
        Reference Architectures: These are pre-defined architectural templates that provide a starting point for the design. They include common structures and patterns that are suitable for the type of system being developed.
        Deployment Patterns: These define the physical layout of the system's components across hardware resources. They determine how the system will be deployed in terms of tiers and layers.
        Externally Developed Components (optional): These are components developed outside of the project that can be integrated into the system. Their selection may influence the choice of reference architectures and deployment patterns.

Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality

    Goal: The goal of the second iteration is to identify structures that support the system's primary functionality. This involves designing the detailed architecture needed to implement the core features and use cases of the system.
    Design Concepts:
        Architectural Patterns: These are recurring solutions to common problems in software architecture. Examples include layers, pipes and filters, and microservices. They help structure the system's components and their interactions.
        Externally Developed Components (optional): Similar to the first iteration, these components are integrated into the system to provide additional functionality. Their selection is influenced by the architectural patterns chosen.

Iterations 3 to n: Refining Previously Created Structures to Fully Address Remaining Drivers

    Goal: The goal of subsequent iterations (3 to n) is to refine the previously created structures to fully address the remaining drivers, which include both functional and non-functional requirements.
    Design Concepts:
        Tactics: These are specific techniques used to achieve particular quality attributes such as performance, security, and modifiability. Tactics provide detailed guidance on how to implement specific architectural decisions.
        Architectural Patterns: Further refinement of architectural patterns may be needed to ensure that the system meets all its requirements.
        Deployment Patterns: Additional deployment patterns may be applied to optimize the physical distribution of components based on the evolving understanding of the system's needs.
        Externally Developed Components (optional): The selection and integration of externally developed components continue as needed to enhance the system's capabilities.

Legend

    Design Concept: Represents the key design elements considered during each iteration.
    Design Concept (optional): Indicates optional design elements that might be considered based on the specific needs and context of the project.
    Influences the Selection of: Shows the influence of certain design concepts on the selection of others. For example, the choice of a reference architecture can influence the selection of deployment patterns and externally developed components.

Overall Process

The process is iterative, with each round of iteration focusing on progressively refining the system architecture. The initial iterations focus on broad, high-level structures, while later iterations delve into more detailed and specific design decisions. Each iteration aims to address a subset of the system's requirements, ensuring that the architecture evolves in a controlled and systematic manner.

This detailed and iterative approach helps ensure that all aspects of the system's architecture are thoroughly considered and that the final design meets all functional and non-functional requirements. The use of established design concepts and patterns helps streamline the design process and leverages proven solutions to common architectural challenges.

FIGURE 3.2 Design concept selection roadmap for greenfield systems

The goal of your initial design iteration(s) should be to address the general architectural concern of establishing an initial overall system structure. Is this to be a three-tier client-server application, a peer-to-peer application, a mobile app connecting to a Big Data back-end, and so on? Each of these options will lead you to different architectural solutions, and these solutions will help you to achieve your drivers. To achieve this iteration goal, you will select some design concepts. Specifically, you will typically choose one or more reference architectures and deployment patterns. You may also select some externally developed components, such as frameworks. The types of frameworks that are typically chosen in early iterations are either “full-stack” frameworks that are associated with the selected reference architectures, or more specific frameworks that are associated with elements established by the reference architecture. In this first iteration, you should review all of your drivers to select the design concepts, but you will probably pay more attention to the constraints and to quality attributes that are not associated with specific functionalities and that favor particular reference architectures or require particular deployment configurations. Consider an example: If you select a reference architecture for Big Data systems, you have presumably chosen a quality attribute such as low latency with high data volumes as your most important driver. Of course, you will make many subsequent decisions to flesh out this early choice, but this driver has already exerted a great influence on your design such as the selection of a particular reference architecture.

The goal of your next design iteration(s) should be to identify structures that support the primary functionality. As noted in Section 2.4.3, allocation of functionality (i.e., use cases or user stories) to elements is an important part of architectural design because it has critical downstream implications for modifiability and allocation of work to teams. Furthermore, once functionality has been allocated, the elements that support it can be refined in later iterations to support the quality attributes associated with these functionalities. For example, a performance scenario may be associated with a particular use case. Achieving the performance goal may require making design decisions across all of the elements that participate in the achievement of this use case. To allocate functionality, you usually refine the elements that are associated with the reference architecture by decomposing them. A particular use case may require the identification of multiple elements. For example, if you have selected a web application reference architecture, supporting a use case will probably require you to identify modules across the different layers associated with this reference architecture. Finally, at this point you should also be thinking about allocating functionality—associated with modules—to (teams of) developers.

The goal of your subsequent design iterations should be to refine the structures you have previously created to fully address the remaining drivers. Addressing these drivers, and especially quality attributes, will likely require you to use the three major categories of design concepts—tactics, patterns, and externally developed components such as frameworks—as well as commonly accepted design best practices such as modularity, low coupling, and high cohesion. For example, to (partially) satisfy a performance requirement for the search use case in a web application, you might select the “maintain multiple copies of data” tactic and implement this tactic by configuring a cache in a framework that is used inside an element responsible for persisting data.

This roadmap is appropriate for the initial project iterations, but it is also extremely useful for early project estimation activities . Simply put, the use of a roadmap results in better architectures, particularly for less mature architects.
